# WordIndexer
The program should read the pages of the book from Page1.txt, Page2.txt, and Page3.txt files. It should also read a list of common words to exclude from the index from the exclude-words.txt file. The program should generate an output file, index.txt, which contains the index of words with the corresponding page numbers.
